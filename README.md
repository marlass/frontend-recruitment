# Frontend recruitment challenge

## About

We created a set of exercises to check your frontend skills required for Software Engineer position at Surfer.

## How to work in Codesandbox or github codespaces?

// TODO: Instruct users about forking, sending solution to us etc.

## Rules

- Feel free to use any resource you need to accomplish given exercise. Using documentation, github repositories, google search, stackoverflow.com is just part of the developer work. Freely use them in this challenge.
- Work on these exercises without anyone's help. We want to test your abilities, not your friend's. After all, if you pass this challenge there will be an interview with a technical part (not when you actually live coding it on the interview ðŸ˜…)
- Everything you need from us is in this README and other project files. If you are not sure how something should be accomplished do it the way you think it's best. This is also supposed to check your decision making and analytical skills. When we want you to do something in a specific way it will be mentioned in the exercise description. P.S. We won't answer your questions like "Can I use ngrx?" or "Do I need to use CSS Grid in this exercise?"
- Please use the very best practices you know. If, for any reason, you can't/won't use the best practices, please explain why you did it this way.
- The final application should build successfully without and errors and warnings.

## Feedback

If you found a mistake in exercise or typo feel free to change our code. When we will be checking your solutions we will take that into account and fix this issue in the challenge for next candidates (you can treat the challenge as an open source project).

We welcome any feedback you have for us (about the challenge or the whole recruitment process). Feel free to write it below.
