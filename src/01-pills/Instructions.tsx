      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>
        Underneath the horizontal line you see a number of pills. Each button
        can be toggled to mark its importance. Go ahead and click one. You will
        notice that the "H" appears on that pill. You can toggle any number of
        pills.
      </p>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        When we toggle pills sometimes they are not able to fit on the same line
        and the last pill in the line is moved to the next line. We don't like
        this sudden layout change and we would like to lay out all the pills at
        the beginning in a way that they won't move between lines when toggled.
      </p>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          designers didn't allow to make the pill same width in toggled on and
          toggled off state. It will always be wider when toggled on.
        </li>
        <li>
          we want to have minimal number of pills lines as possible. We can't
          reserve hardcoded eg. 25% of line width for the wider buttons, because
          that would probably waste some space.
        </li>
        <li>pill will never ever change line during pills toggling</li>
        <li>
          ideally only make changes in <code>Pills.tsx</code> file
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>extra</b>: on browser window resize the pills layout will be
          updated to optimally use the new container width
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
};
