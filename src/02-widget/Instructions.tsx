      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>
        Underneath the horizontal line you see widget where we promote our
        content. Inside the widget we have an iframe that displays content from
        our marketing site. Widget and the included iframe are build to be
        responsive.
      </p>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Content in our iframe is dynamic and have different height depending on
        the iframe width. This means that we have to dynamically set the iframe
        height to match the height of it's content.
      </p>
      <h4>How can you reproduce that?</h4>
      <p>
        With big screen width the iframe height currently is 117px and that's
        the value we set manually. However with small screen width (600px) the
        iframe height is bigger and we see scrollbars or content being cut in
        the iframe.
      </p>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          when you open content on different screen width whole iframe content
          should be visible without scrollbars
        </li>
        <li>
          iframe is currently from the same origin, but the solution should work
          also for cross origin iframe. That means that you can't access
          internals (eg. document, window) of iframe from the widget itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          iframe should not "flicker" on initial render (showing for a fraction
          of second iframe with incorrect width/height)
        </li>
        <li>
          developer who worked on this task left the code a bit sloppy. Try to
          improve it in areas like TypeScript and good React practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>extra</b>: when you dynamically change screen width iframe width
          and height should adjust accordingly
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          use <code>parent.postMessage</code> to communicate from iframe to
          widget
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
};
